    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

[ABOUT]
This tool enables you to modify your Ps3 or Xbox360 save data.
It does not require any third party app, unless your usb device is not supported by the program.
This program is purely design to edit your save data for offline usage... if used online then a ban would be your own damn fault.

I do not condone online cheating, nor abusing  other gaming experience and i'm not responsible for any damage you might cause to your self or others
Please use this tool with caution.

I, so please use with caution.

The new version brings a new system that will be used for any advanced program.
The system is designed to bring ease to any user, and especially to me when making updates.
It is needed because there are too many leechers who didnt show any appreciations.
The tool has been used by more then 14000 users, and only 250 of them could give a proper thanks.
Thats actually a pretty bad insult considering the time and effort i put into my tools...

That era is gone, only registered users are now able to use and profit from all the nice features that will come.
The system includes a donation method that allows you to donate any amount you want.
All donations will be received and processed automaticly.
This tool will be all free, but only requires you to donate for the DLC items.
If you wish to use the first dlc then 1$ is required, first and second will be 2$ and all three requires you to donate 3$.

The 3th dlc will be added once it has been released.

[Registration]
Since version 2.0.0.0 is registration required.
You can use the account for any other tool from now on.
After you have registered, you will be able to send bugs to me, check your donations, view the app information,recieve updates and so on.
The account will be bound to the system you registered on.
If you log in from another OS then your account will be suspended until you activate it.
Whenever your account gets activated , the OS you performed the task on will be your default OS.
Each time you switch from Machine , you will need to reactive the account.

There will be no sensitive data stored whatsoever.

[Donations]
Every donation you will make will be stored and rewarded with exclusive features.
If you don't get rewarded enough in this tool, then you will get compensated in the next one.
This will keep me motivated, and ensures that you guys always get the best stuff you deserve.
Its true that some might find this stupid, like always ... 
but they are not restricted in using this tool, infact, everyone will be able to use any of my tools, but it might be limited in some parts.
Show your appreciation and ill show mine!

If you already made a donation then you can contact me with your payment details and ill adjust your account.
Be sure to contact me using the program.

[USAGE]
To be able to use anything from the tool , you would need to login first.
Before you can login you will need to register and activate your account.
After successful login, you will be able to use the tool as you where used to.

The only thing that has changed as of the usage is the donation part to use the dlc items.
